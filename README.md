 Predicting Flight Delays & Passenger Volume at BWI Airport

Hult International Business School – Individual Capstone
As part of a comprehensive analytics assignment, I developed a dual-model strategy for Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport to enhance operational efficiency and support strategic decision-making.

Flight Delay Classification
Built a neural network model to predict delays (≥15 min) using flight, weather, and airline data. Tuned the model for optimal precision and recall to support real-time risk identification in the Airport Operations Control Center (AOCC).

Passenger Volume Forecasting
Applied SARIMA to forecast monthly passenger traffic from June 2025 to May 2026. Forecasts informed planning for staffing, vendor operations, and retail lease structuring.

Business Impact Recommendations
Integrate delay alerts into AOCC workflows
Design flexible retail lease terms tied to forecasted peaks
Align TSA and contractor staffing with monthly demand
Reassign gates based on delay risk and load factor
Launch joint forecasting initiatives with Southwest (71% market share at BWI)

Tools & Methods: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, XGBoost, SARIMA, scikit-learn
